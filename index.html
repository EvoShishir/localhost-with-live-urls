        <h2>Why Professional Throw Pillow Cleaning is Essential?</h2>
        <p>
          While vacuuming and spot-cleaning can help maintain the look of your
          throw pillows, they don’t eliminate deep-seated dirt, dust mites, pet
          dander, or allergens. Professional cleaning removes these
          contaminants, so that your pillows remain fresh, hygienic, and
          comfortable. Our expert cleaning methods help:
        </p>
        <ul class="check-square">
          <li>
            Extend the lifespan of your throw pillows by preventing fabric
            breakdown.
          </li>
          <li>Eliminate tough stains and odors for a new-like appearance.</li>
          <li>
            Improve indoor air quality by removing trapped allergens and
            bacteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain the vibrant colors and textures of your pillows, keeping
            your home stylish.

        <h2>How Often Should You Clean Throw Pillows?</h2>
        <p>
          The frequency of throw pillow cleaning depends on usage and household
          factors. Here’s a general guideline:
        </p>
        <ul class="check-square">
          <li>
            <strong>Every 3-6 months</strong>: For homes with pets, kids, or
            allergy sufferers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Every 6-12 months</strong>: For decorative pillows that
            aren’t used daily.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Seasonal cleaning</strong>: Ideal for maintaining freshness
            and reducing dust buildup.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your pillows start to look dull, smell musty, or trigger allergies,
          it’s time for a deep clean!
